# EVE Online Wormhole Rolling Application - Development Summary

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive EVE Online wormhole rolling application built with vanilla JavaScript, featuring both a tracking mode for real operations and a game mode for practice/simulation. The application uses a modern EVE console aesthetic with compact, angular design elements.

## Major Features Developed

### 1. **Dual Mode System**
- **Tracker Mode**: Track real in-game wormhole rolling operations with staging and manual outcome application
- **Game Mode**: Play wormhole rolling as a game with hidden actual mass and immediate outcomes

### 2. **Random Events System**
- Multi-action random events that can occur during gameplay
- Events include "Good Get" (famous griefer) and random neutral ships
- One random event maximum per game session
- Events process after player actions for proper timing

### 3. **Comprehensive Ship & Wormhole Logic**
- Support for all EVE ship types with hot/cold/unknown mass modes
- Wormhole size restrictions and state management (fresh/stable/destab/critical/gone)
- Progressive mass calculations with realistic EVE mechanics

### 4. **EVE Console UI Design**
- Complete redesign from rounded, spacious interface to angular, compact EVE aesthetic
- Monospace fonts (Consolas/Monaco/Courier New)
- EVE color scheme (#0d1117 backgrounds, #58a6ff accents)
- Compact spacing (3-8px padding vs original 15-30px)
- Small, efficient text (11-12px vs original 14-18px)

## Technical Implementations

### **Core Architecture**
- **Classes**: `GameModeBase`, `TrackerMode`, `GameMode`, `WormholeRollingUI`
- **Data Models**: `Ship`, `CustomMass`, `Action`, `Wormhole`
- **Configuration**: Ship types, wormhole states, mass types, restrictions

### **Game Mechanics**
- Hidden actual mass vs displayed mass ranges
- Progressive mass impact calculations
- State boundary enforcement
- Ships on far side tracking for win/loss conditions
- Mass variance (±10%) for realistic wormhole behavior

### **Random Events Engine**
- Probability-based event triggering (0.5% chance each)
- Multi-action event processing with sequential mass impacts
- Wormhole restriction compliance filtering
- Proper UI logging and state management

## Bug Fixes & Optimizations

### **Critical Fixes**
1. **DisplayStatus Error**: Removed non-existent method call causing console errors
2. **Random Events Timing**: Fixed events to occur after player actions instead of before
3. **Random Event UI Logging**: Fixed missing UI display when events cause wormhole collapse
4. **Mass Calculation Logic**: Corrected progressive mass impact for accurate game state
5. **Button Alignment**: Unified button containers and standardized sizing

### **UI Improvements**
- **Complete EVE Aesthetic**: Transformed from generic web styling to authentic EVE console interface
- **Button Consistency**: Fixed random and start button sizing (both 28px height, 140px min-width)
- **Compact Spacing**: Reduced padding throughout for efficiency-focused appearance
- **Angular Design**: Replaced rounded corners (8px→2px) for sharp, technical look

- Integration tests for UI interactions and state management
- All tests maintained throughout development cycle

## Key Technical Achievements

### **Game Mode Logic**
- Hidden actual mass system with realistic variance
- Progressive state transitions based on mass percentage
- Accurate win/loss determination with far side ship tracking
- Console logging for debugging and transparency

### **Random Events**
- Multi-action event system with proper mass impact calculation
- State change detection and UI notification
- Wormhole collapse handling with proper game termination
- One-event-per-game limit for balanced gameplay

### **EVE UI Transformation**
- Complete visual overhaul maintaining functionality
- Responsive design principles preserved
- Accessibility standards maintained
- Performance optimization through simplified DOM structure

## Development Statistics
- **Session Duration**: Multiple development sessions over several days
- **Lines of Code**: ~1,500+ lines across all files
- **Test Coverage**: 36 comprehensive unit tests
- **UI Components**: 15+ distinct interface sections
- **Ship Types**: 9 different EVE ship configurations
- **Wormhole Types**: 8 mass categories with 5 state types

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
